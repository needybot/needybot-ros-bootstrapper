#Contribution Guidelines
We love Needybot. We want you to love Needybot as well, and to feel free to contribute to Needybot. There are a few ways you can take part in the Needybot Project, and we are always here to help you help Needy. 

Please observe the following guidelines as you take part in the Needybot Project to make it as productive, safe, and welcoming as possible for all those involved.

##Code of Conduct
The Needybot Project adheres to the Contributors Covenant Code of Conduct which can be found [here](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/), and is included in every Needybot package we make available to the community.


##Issues & Bugs
If you have found an issue with Needybot please file it on the appropriate GitHub project. For example, an issue found in the needybot-core package should be filed there, not in needybot-dialog.

When filing your issue please make sure you provide a reproducible test—we need to be able to reproduce the issue to be able to help with it.

When reporting an issue we also need as much information about your environment that you can include. If you are using our official parts list, it will be easy for us to replicate, but if you’ve used your own parts to build your Needybot, it could potentially be impossible for us to replicate without knowing what you are running your Needybot on.

##Features
If you would like to request a feature or design-related change, please file an issue in the appropriate repository. Please try to include as much information as possible including:

* Use case and/or benefits of the feature to the broader community
* Whether you would like to work on the feature yourself or if you are looking to have the Needybot core contributors make the change
* Any caveats and concerns you have regarding the usage of the feature
* A test plan or testing scenario to validate the feature
* Any additional information you have such as real-world data and observations of user behavior

##Code Contributions
We welcome your additions to the Needybot Project. If you decide you have an addition you’d like to make, please ensure you’ve at least done the following:

1. Fork the Needybot package to which you’d like to add a feature.
1. Make your changes, properly documenting any new functionality using the documentation standards for the language, either     Python or C++ (this includes classes, methods and functions, properties, etc.).
1. Include the proper inline documentation for any change you make.
1. Cover all new functionality with complete unit tests, and make sure they pass.
1. Commit your changes and submit a PR (that includes your name and a detailed description of the changes you’ve made) to the    appropriate package.

In order to speed up the process of accepting your contributions, you should try to make your checkins as small as possible, avoid any unnecessary deltas and the need to rebase.

In some situations a project maintainer may connect with you to review design decisions and mitigate issues as part of the contribution process. In some situations, we may decide to decline your pull request and instead log the issue for a future product milestone or bug fix. The team will provide information in the pull in these situations and still thank you for your contribution.
